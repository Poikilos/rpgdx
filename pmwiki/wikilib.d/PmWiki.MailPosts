text=The mailposts.php script allows a site administrator to configure PmWiki ²to send email messages whenever pages are changed on the wiki site.²MailPosts can be configured so that multiple page changes over a short²period of time are combined into a single email message (to avoid ²flooding a mailbox).²²The MailPosts feature is especially useful for sites that have infrequent²updates, eliminating the need to frequently check RecentChanges²pages just to see if anything has changed.²²Full configuration details are available in scripts/mailposts.php, but here's the brief synopsis of what needs to go in local.php or a per-group customization script for MailPosts:² [=$EnableMailPosts=1;                   # to enable mailposts² $MailPostsTo="somebody@example.com";  # where to send mail notifications² $MailPostsDelay=1800;                 # wait for initial post to age 30 minutes² $MailPostsSquelch=7200;               # require at least two hours between mails=]²Note that [=$MailPostsTo=] may be a comma-separated list of addresses if multiple recipients are desired.  ²²Since an initial post is often followed by several posts containing minor edits, it's useful to wait a short period of time before sending an email.  [=$MailPostsDelay=] is the minimum amount of time that must elapse from an initial post before a message is sent.  Any additional posts occuring during the delay period are included in the message when it is sent.  The message is sent on the first execution of pmwiki.php after the delay period has expired (which for inactive sites could be much longer than the delay period).  A delay of zero means to immediately send a message whenever an update is received.²²[=$MailPostsSquelch=] specifies the minimum amount of time that must elapse before sending another notification message.  This is useful to prevent large number of rapid-succession messages if [=$MailPostsDelay=] is set to a small value.  ²²The defaults for [=$MailPostsDelay=] and [=$MailPostsSquelch=] are 0 and 7200. With these values, an email is sent as soon as a page is changed, and subsequent changes are "held" for at least two hours before being sent in another message.²²There are other configuration variables to control the return email address, the text of the message being sent, etc.  For details on these, see scripts/mailposts.php.²²<<|DocumentationIndex|>>
