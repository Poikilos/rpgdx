text=This page describes how a WikiAdministrator can create additional InterMap links.²²The file @@intermap.txt@@ in the scripts directory specifies the default InterMap links that are distributed with PmWiki.  Each line of @@intermap.txt@@ has the following format:²    [=HostPrefix       http://www.somehost.com/partial/url/=]²For example, @@intermap.txt@@ has the following entries:² [=   PmWiki          http://www.pmichaud.com/wiki/PmWiki/²    Wiki            http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?²    Meatball        http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?²    UseMod          http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?²    ISBN            http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/²    Wikipedia       http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/=]²²To create your own InterMap links, '''do not edit the @@intermap.txt@@ file directly!'''  (You'll lose your changes when you do a PmWiki.{{Upgrade|s}}.)  Instead, create a file called @@localmap.txt@@ in the @@local/@@ subdirectory containing your InterMap links in the format described above.  PmWiki will automatically read your links after loading the @@intermap.txt@@ entries.²²The intermap technique is also useful to get access to uploaded documents of other groups. Supposed a group called @@Figures@@ is used you can add a line²   [=figures	http://www.somehost.com/uploads/Figures/=]²Then you may use @@figures:your-upload.doc@@ from any group in the PmWiki. ²²%trail%<<|PmWiki.DocumentationIndex|>>²²
