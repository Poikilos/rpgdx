text=The WikiTrails feature allows wiki authors to create "trails" through sequences of pages in the wiki.  To do this, an author creates a "trail page" that gives the sequence of page names as either a bullet or numbered list.  The page names must be the first item following each bullet.  Then, for each page on the trail, add the markup [="<<|TrailPage|>>"=] somewhere on the page (usually at the bottom).  This markup will then be replaced with links to the previous and next pages in the trail, as defined by the [=TrailPage=].²²As an example, the page PmWiki.DocumentationIndex defines a {{WikiTrail|s}} through the set of pages that make up the documentation for PmWiki.  The special markup ²  [=<<|PmWiki.DocumentationIndex|>>=]²appears at the bottom of each page along the trail, providing links to the previous and next pages in the trail sequence.  Note that this makes²reorganizing the sequence of pages or adding new pages quite easy--²simply edit the trail page (PmWiki.DocumentationIndex in this case).²²There are a couple of other markups available:  [=^|TrailPage|^=] will show a page's ancestry to the trail page, while [=<|TrailPage|>=] will completely omit the "[=<PrevPage|=]" or "[=|NextPage>=]" markups at the beginning or end of the trail respectively.  ²²%trail%<<|PmWiki.DocumentationIndex|>>²
