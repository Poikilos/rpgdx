text=This page documents the variables available in PmWiki for LocalCustomizations.  This page is still very incomplete--the most common/useful variables have been listed here and others will be added as people have time to document them. For the time being look into pmwiki.php to see all variables.²²:@@[=$ScriptUrl=]@@:²: :The URL-location of the wiki server.  PmWiki will try to figure this out on its own from the web server's HTTP environment variables, but you might want to tell PmWiki to use a different URL because of aliases or redirects.²²:@@[=$DefaultGroup=]@@:²: :The "default" group for the wiki server.  PmWiki's default value is @@Main@@.²²:@@[=$DefaultTitle=]@@:²: :The title of the "default page" within each group.  PmWiki's default value is @@[=HomePage=]@@.²²:@@[=$DefaultPage=]@@:²: :The default page for the wiki server if none is specified.  Defaults to @@[="$DefaultGroup.$DefaultTitle"=]@@ if it is not set in @@local.php@@.²²:@@[=$WikiImgUrl=]@@:²: :The URL for the logo image used when browsing pages (as called by @@[=$PageHeaderFmt=]@@.²²:@@[=$HTMLHeaderFmt=]@@:²: :Any additional HTML markup that should be included in the <HEAD>...<HEAD> section of the pages that PmWiki generates.  The default value of @@[=$HTMLHeaderFmt=]@@ is the stylesheet used for generating "diff" (page revision history) pages and for setting the left margin and page width via the @@[=$BodyLeft=]@@ and @@[=$BodyWidth=]@@ variables.²²:@@[=$PageHeaderFmt=]@@:²: :The HTML markup that goes at the beginning of the <BODY> section of the pages that PmWiki generates. The default value of @@[=$PageHeaderFmt=]@@ establishes the visible header and the standard menus.  See also CustomHeadersAndFooters.²²:@@[=$PageFooterFmt=]@@:²: :The HTML markup that goes at the end of the <BODY> section of the pages that PmWiki generates. The default value of @@[=$PageFooterFmt=]@@ is establishes the visible footer.  See also CustomHeadersAndFooters.²²:@@[=$pagename=]@@:²: :The name of the page to be operated on.²²:@@[=$action=]@@:²: :The action the user is attempting.  Standard values are "browse", "source", "edit", "post", "attr", "postattr", "diff", "search", and "crypt".  It's possible to intercept (and possibly modify) @@[=$action=]@@ in @@local.php@@ to add localized capabilities to PmWiki.  If PmWiki doesn't recognize the value of [=$action=], then "browse" is assumed.²²:@@[=$BodyLeft=]@@:²: :By default, PmWiki places its output in a <DIV> section to control the margins of the output.  @@[=$BodyLeft=]@@ is used to specify the number of pixels of left margin for the page (default value: 20).²²:@@[=$BodyWidth=]@@:²: :PmWiki places its output in a <DIV> section to control the margins of output.  @@[=$BodyWidth=]@@ is used to specify the width of the displayed output in pixels (default value: 600).²²:@@[=$DeleteKeyWord=]@@:²: :The keyword used to delete pages.  The page contents must exactly match this value in order for the page to be deleted.  Default value is "delete".  Note that PmWiki doesn't actually delete the page file--it simply renames the file to a unique name so that the page can be recovered by an admin if necessary.²²:@@[=$WikiTitle=]@@:²: :The title to be used for the system (e.g., in the browser window's titlebar).  Default is "PmWiki".²²:@@[=$DiffKeepDays=]@@:²: :The minimum number of days of revision history to keep for each page.  The default is 3650 (ten years).  Outdated revision history information is removed only when a user edits the page.  Thus it's possible for pages to display revision history details older than the time given by this parameter.²²:@@[=$SpaceWikiWords=]@@:²: :If set to 1, all wikwords are printed with spaces. It is the same effect as [=[[=]spacewikiwords]] PmWiki.SpecialMarkups .²²²%trail%<<|PmWiki.DocumentationIndex|>>
