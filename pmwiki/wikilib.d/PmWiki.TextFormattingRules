More colons at the beginning (@@:: :@@) produce larger indents.²² : :Four score and seven years ago our fathers placed upon this² continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the² proposition that all men are created equal.²²: :Four score and seven years ago our fathers placed upon this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.²²----²[[#BulletedLists]]²'''Bulleted Lists'''²²Bullet lists are made by placing asterisks at the left margin.  More asterisks increases the level of bullet:²² * First-level list item² ** Second-level list item² ** Another second-level item² * A first-level item²²* First-level list item²** Second-level list item²** Another second-level item²* A first-level item²²----²'''Horizontal Line'''²²Four or more dashes ([=----=]) at the beginning of a line produce a horizontal line²²²----²'''Emphasis'''²²* Use doubled single-quotes ([=''=]), i.e., ''two apostrophies'', for emphasis (usually ''italics'')²* Use tripled single-quotes ([='''=]), i.e. ''three apostrophies'', for strong emphasis (usually '''bold''')²* Use five single-quotes ([='''''=]), or triples within doubles (''five apostrophies''), for some other kind of emphasis (usually '''''bold italics''''')²* Use doubled at-signs ([=@@=]) for @@monospace@@ text²* Use [=[+...+]=] for [+larger text+] and [=[-...-]=] for [-smaller text-]²* Emphasis can be used multiple times within a line, but cannot span across line boundaries -- you can't put a paragraph break in the middle of bold text.²²See also WikiStyles for advanced text formatting options.²²----²'''References'''²²* Join capitalized words ({{WikiWord}}s) to make references to other pages on this Wiki.²* Precede [=URLs=] with "http:", "ftp:", "gopher:", "mailto:", or "news:" to create links automatically as in http://www.pmichaud.com/toast.²* [=URLs=] ending with .gif, .jpg, or .png are displayed as images in the page²** An image URL at the beginning of a line "floats left" with text wrapped around it.²** An image URL at the end of a line "floats right" with text wrapped around it.²** An image URL on a line by itself appears by itself in the output.²* [=URLs=] can be placed in double brackets [[''url'']] when the URL itself is not important to the text.  For example, [=[[http://www.google.com/]]=]  will appear as [[http://www.google.com/]].²* Links with arbitrary text can be created in double brackets as [[''url'' ''text'']] or [[''WikiWord'' ''text'']].  ''Text'' can be an image URL, in which case the image becomes the link to the remote ''url'' or ''WikiWord''.²* Anchor targets within pages (#-links) can be created using @@[=[[#target]]=]@@.²²----²'''[=FreeLinks=]'''²²A {{free link|s}} is a page name reference that doesn't follow the WikiWord convention.²²Often, there is no natural WikiWord for naming a page. That's when @@[={{free links}}=]@@ (a page called {{free links}}) are useful. The @@[={{text}}=]@@ markup creates a link to a page called '''Text'''. The markup @@[={{basic editing}}=]@@ markup creates a link to a page called '''[=BasicEditing=]''' and displays as {{basic editing}}.  Suffixes and plurals are also possible, thus @@[={{wiki word}}s=]@@ produces {{wiki word}}s.²²For more information please see the FreeLinks documentation.²²----²'''Headings'''²²Headings are made by placing a exclamation mark ('''!''') at the left margin.  More exclamation marks increases the level of heading.  For example,²	! Level 1 Heading²! Level 1 Heading²	!! Level 2 Heading²!! Level 2 Heading²	!!! Level 3 Heading²!!! Level 3 Heading²²----²'''Escape sequence'''²²Anything placed between [=[=]= and =] is not interpreted by PmWiki/PmWiki.²This makes it possible to easily do [=WikiWords=] that are not links and turn off other special formatting interpretation.  The [=[=]= and =] can span multiple input lines, allowing effects to be applied to multiple input lines.  For example, space+[[===] at the beginning of a line will cause the text up to the next =] to be monospace and uninterpreted by PmWiki/PmWiki (useful for program listings).²²----²'''Numbered Lists'''²²Numbered lists are made by placing number-signs (#) at the left margin.²² # Prepare the experiment² ## Unwrap the pop-tart² ## Insert the pop-tart into the toaster² # Begin cooking the pop tart² # Stand back²²# Prepare the experiment²## Unwrap the pop-tart²## Insert the pop-tart into the toaster²# Begin cooking the pop tart²# Stand back²²----²[[#DefinitionLists]]²'''Definition Lists'''²²²Definition lists are made by placing colons at the left margin:²²[=:term:definition of term=]²[=::second-level item: definition of 2nd-level item=]²²:term:definition of term²::second-level item: definition of 2nd-level item²²----²'''Tables'''²²Table are defined by enclosing cells with '||'.  A cell with leading and trailing spaces is centered; a cell with leading spaces is right-aligned; all other cells are left-aligned.  An empty cell will cause the previous cell to span multiple columns.  (There is currently no mechanism for spanning multiple rows.)  A line beginning with '||' specifies the table attributes for subsequent tables.²² [=²        ||align=center border=1 width=50%²        ||Left   || Center ||  Right||²        ||A      ||    B   ||      C||²        || multi span    ||||       ||²=]²||align=center border=1 width=50%²||Left   || Center ||  Right||²||A      ||    B   ||      C||²|| multi span    ||||       ||²²For more information see SimpleTables, SimpleTablesII and AdvancedTables.²²----²'''Special characters'''²²The table gives a complete list of characters that PmWiki supports.²²||align=center width=100% border=1²||'''Type''' ||'''To get this''' ||'''Write this''' ||²||Punctuation ||&iquest; &iexcl; &laquo; &raquo; &sect; &para; &dagger; &Dagger; &bull; &mdash; &ndash; &amp; ||[=&iquest; &iexcl; &laquo; &raquo; &sect; &para; &dagger; &Dagger; &bull; &mdash; &ndash; &amp; =] ||²||Commercial ||&trade; &copy; &reg; &cent; &euro; &yen;  &pound; &curren; ||[=&trade; &copy; &reg; &cent; &euro; &yen;  &pound; &curren;=] ||²||Greek ||&alpha; &beta; &gamma; &delta; &epsilon; &zeta; &eta; &theta; &iota;[[<<]] &kappa; &lambda; &mu; &nu;  &xi; &omicron; &pi; &rho;  &sigma;[[<<]] &sigmaf; &tau; &upsilon; &phi; &chi; &psi; &omega; &Gamma; &Delta;[[<<]] &Theta; &Lambda; &Xi; &Pi;  &Sigma; &Phi; &Psi; &Omega; ||[=&alpha; &beta; &gamma; &delta; &epsilon; &zeta; &eta; &theta; &iota; =][[<<]][=&kappa; &lambda; &mu; &nu; &xi; &omicron; &pi; &rho;  &sigma;=][[<<]][= &sigmaf; &tau; &upsilon; &phi; &chi; &psi; &omega; &Gamma; &Delta;=][[<<]][= &Theta; &Lambda; &Xi; &Pi; &Sigma; &Phi; &Psi; &Omega;=] ||²||Maths ||&int; &sum; &prod; &radic; &minus; &plusmn; &infin; &asymp;[[<<]] &prop; &equiv; &ne; &le; &ge; &rarr; &times; &middot;[[<<]] &divide; &part; &prime; &Prime; &nabla; &permil; &deg; &there4;[[<<]] &alefsym; &oslash; &isin; &notin; &cap; &cup; &sub; &sup;[[<<]] &sube; &supe; &not; &and; &or; &exist; &forall; &rArr; &hArr; ||[=&int; &sum; &prod; &radic; &minus; &plusmn; &infin; &asymp; =][[<<]][= &prop; &equiv; &ne; &le; &ge; &rarr; &times; &middot; =][[<<]][= &divide; &part; &prime; &Prime; &nabla; &permil; &deg; &there4; =][[<<]][= &alefsym; &oslash; &isin; &notin; &cap; &cup; &sub; &sup; =][[<<]][= &sube; &supe; &not; &and; &or; &exist; &forall; &rArr; &hArr;=] ||²||Spacing ||x&nbsp;&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;&nbsp;y (prevents line breaks in the middle of text) ||[=x&nbsp;&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;&nbsp;y=] ||²||Accents ||&Agrave; &Aacute; &Acirc; &Atilde; &Auml; &Aring;  &Ccedil; &Egrave; &Eacute; &Ecirc; &Euml;  &Igrave; &Iacute; &Icirc; &Iuml; &Ntilde; &Ograve;  &Oacute; &Ocirc; &Otilde; &Ouml; &Oslash; &Ugrave;  &Uacute; &Ucirc; &Uuml; &szlig; &agrave; &aacute;  &acirc; &atilde; &auml; &aring; &aelig; &ccedil; &egrave; &eacute; &ecirc; &euml; &igrave; &iacute; &icirc; &iuml; &ntilde; &ograve; &oacute; &ocirc; &otilde; &ouml; &oslash; &ugrave; &uacute; &ucirc;  &uuml; &yuml; ||[=&Agrave; &Aacute; &Acirc; &Atilde; &Auml; &Aring;  &Ccedil; &Egrave; &Eacute; &Ecirc; &Euml;  &Igrave; &Iacute; &Icirc; &Iuml; &Ntilde; &Ograve;  &Oacute; &Ocirc; &Otilde; &Ouml; &Oslash; &Ugrave;  &Uacute; &Ucirc; &Uuml; &szlig; &agrave; &aacute;  &acirc; &atilde; &auml; &aring; &aelig; &ccedil;  &egrave; &eacute; &ecirc; &euml; &igrave; &iacute;  &icirc; &iuml; &ntilde; &ograve; &oacute; &ocirc;  &otilde; &ouml; &oslash; &ugrave; &uacute; &ucirc;  &uuml; &yuml;=] ||²²The one standard special character it doesn't support is the Æ ligature, because the HTML entity name is [= &AElig; =] and this gets interpreted as a WikiWord. ²²%trail%<<|PmWiki.DocumentationIndex|>>²
