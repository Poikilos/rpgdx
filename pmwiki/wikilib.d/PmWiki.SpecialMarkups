text=There are a lot of specialized markups that make use of the double bracket [[...]] sequence, many of these are described here.²²'''Search'''²:[[[==]$Search]]:A PmWiki text-search box. Normally used in Main.SearchWiki but can be placed anywhere.  [[$Search]]²----²'''Titles, Groups, etc.'''²:[[[==]$Title]] - The page title, as in "[[$Title]]":²:[[[==]$Group]] - the page group name, as in "[[$Group]]":²:[[[==]$Titlespaced]] - the page title spaced, as in "[[$Titlespaced]]":²:[[[==]$Groupspaced]] - the group name spaced, as in "[[$Groupspaced]]":²:[[[=$LastModified=]]] - the date the page was last modified:²:[[[=$LastModifiedHost=]]] - the host that performed the last modification:²:[[[=$DefaultGroup=]]] - the wiki server's default group, as in "[[$DefaultGroup]]":²:[[[=$Attachlist=]]] - see UploadsAdmin:²²----²'''Header & Footer'''²:[[[==]noheader]]:²:[[[==]nofooter]]:²:[[[==]nogroupheader]]:²: :Turns off the PmWiki-generated header, footer, or group header for the page.²----²'''Includes'''²:[[include[=:=]''[=WikiWord=]'']]:²:[[include[=:=]''[=GroupName.WikiWord=]'']]:²::Note that there's no space after the colon.²::Includes the text of another wiki page in this one.  Note that this can mangle references if the included page belongs to another group (use ''$ThisPage'' for references to anchors within a page to prevent included anchors from breaking).²::To prevent infinite loops of includes, only a limited number of includes are actually executed (controlled by the configuration variable ''$MaxIncludes'', which defaults to 10).  If you need more than 10 included files in a page, speak with the WikiAdministrator.²----²[[#MiscBracketAbuse]]²'''Misc Bracket Abuse'''²:[[[=<<=]]]:²::Forces a line break, specifically inserts the HTML "''<br clear='all'>''"²:[[[=$Version=]]]:²::Display the PmWiki/PmWiki version number, i.e. "[[$Version]]"²:[[[=$Edit=] ''text'']]:²::Display an ''Edit'' link, like this [[$Edit Click This Link To Edit This Page]]²:[[[=$Diff=] ''text'']]:²::Display a ''Revisions'' link, like this [[$Diff Click This Link To See Page Revisions]]²:[[[=spacewikiwords=]]]:²::Place this directive in a page and it will cause all of the {{WikiWord}}s in the page to be displayed with spaces. (Of course, [[[=spacewikiwords=]]] can go in a {{GroupHeader|s}} page to cause all pages in a group to be displayed with spaced {{WikiWord}}s.). This can also be turned on by setting @@$spacewikiwords=1@@ in customization (see PmWiki.{{Variables}}).²:[[[=#anchorname=]]]:²::Creates an anchor in a webpage.²²%trail%<<|PmWiki.DocumentationIndex|>>
