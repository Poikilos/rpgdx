text=PmWiki is designed to be usable as a web site maintenance tool, and frequently administrators will want to be able to provide access to PmWiki pages without having "pmwiki.php" appear in the address bar of the users' browser windows.  This page describes ways to have your PmWiki installation appear as a URL other than that of the @@pmwiki.php@@ script itself.  The examples below assume that a URL such as [=http://www.example.com/wiki=] is being set to refer to pmwiki.php on the www.example.com website.²²There are three basic ways to accomplish this.  First, if you have access to the web server configuration file, then simply adding the line²        Alias /wiki /path/to/pmwiki.php²to the configuration file will perform the alias for you.²²If you don't have access to the configuration file, then a little bit of redirection is needed.  First, create a file (not a directory) called "wiki" at the location where the webserver would normally access the "/wiki" URL.  Often this is the web server's [=DocumentRoot=] directory, but it really depends on your site's configuration.  Place the following PHP script in the @@wiki@@ file:²        <?php chdir("/path/to/pmwikidir"); include("pmwiki.php"); ?>²In the script, replace @@/path/to/pmwikidir@@ with the name of the directory containing @@pmwiki.php@@.  Then, add the following lines to the @@.htaccess@@ file in the same directory as the @@wiki@@ file (create the @@.htaccess@@ file if doesn't exist):²        <Files wiki>²        [=SetHandler=] application/x-httpd-php²        </Files>²This tells the webserver to treat the @@wiki@@ file as a PHP script even though it doesn't end in @@.php@@.  Now, requests for your @@wiki@@ file will cause the web server to change to the directory containing @@pmwiki.php@@ and execute it from there.²²A third method is to just rename "pmwiki.php" to a more suitable name, for instance "do.php". If you're going to use the [[http://www.mrunix.net/webalizer/ webalizer]] web log analysis, please don't rename "pmwiki.php" to "index.php". Webalizer 'strips' urls after the 'index.' part, thus effectively destroying all page referrals. For instance: access to '/index.php/Main/Abc' and '/index.php/Main/Xyz' are both referred to as '/', with two counts.²²%trail%<<|PmWiki.DocumentationIndex|>>
