text=WikiWikiWeb is an "open-editing" system where the emphasis is on the authoring and collaboration of documents rather than the simple browsing or viewing of them.  The basic concept of a WikiWikiWeb (or "wiki") is that (almost) anyone can edit any page.  While at first this sounds like a recipe for complete anarchy, the truth is that sites using this system have developed surprisingly complex and rich communities for online collaboration and communication.  Yes, it's possible for someone to go and destroy everything on a page, but it doesn't seem to happen often.  And, many systems (including this one) have built-in mechanisms to restore content that has been defaced or destroyed.²²The point of the system is to simply make it as easy and rewarding as possible to create or edit online content.  Using any standard Web browser, a person can edit (almost) any page on the system using relatively simple TextFormattingRules.  Creating a link to a new or existing page simply involves entering a WikiWord--a word consisting of several capitalized words joined together--to reference and serve as a title for the target page.²²It's not even necessary to learn the TextFormattingRules; others will often come in and reformat things for you.  After all, anyone can edit!  '''You''' can see some of the RecentChanges that others have posted to this site.²²To learn more about adding pages to this Wiki site, see our TipsForEditing, then try editing pages in the Main/WikiSandbox.
