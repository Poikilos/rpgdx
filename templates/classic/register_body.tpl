<h3>The registration process</h3>

<p>RPGDX and the forums share their user database for convenience, you'll only have to register once and be able to login at both parts of the site. They do not however share session information, so you'll still have to login twice. When you use the auto login feature at RPGDX as well as at the forums, this should not be a problem.</p>

<h3>Rules</h3>

<p>You must abide to the following rules when posting games on RPGDX:</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>The game and all it's contents must be yours.</li>
<li>The game must be an RPG.</li>
<li>The game must be an independently made game (i.e. no outside commercial funding).</li>
<li>If your game costs $$ for people to play, you must have at least a free downloadable demo somewhere on your site.</li>
<li>All games should have *all* required files included in their download for people to play. This includes emulators, DLL files, and anything else.</li>
<li>It does not matter if your RPG is finished or not.  In-progress games are perfectly ok.</li>
</ul>
Any games that go against these standards will be removed instantly.
</p>
