# rpgdx website

The rpgdx website is a mildly customized fork of phpBB 2.0.23 with:
- different table names
- some bot protections
- a custom template
- a parent folder with a main web page (that utilizes phpBB)
  - therefore only the "forums" folder is equivalent to phpBB.

## Why phpBB 2 not 3?
The customizations to 2 are not yet fully ported to 3.
There is a clear and relatively safe upgrade path from 2 to 3.3 *usually*, but due to our custom table names and other customizations:
- The customizations may have to be ported to 3 *before* the import feature is used (both the import feature itself and the forum code would likely have to be edited before the import process can run safely).

Due to the time requirement for porting to 3 and the site becoming more or less archival, further patching a readonly instance of the phpBB 2 version is considered as a safe hosting option. Maintaining the 2.0.23-based code is acceptable since 2.0.23 is the last version of 2.x.

If anyone wants to port RPGDX to phpBB 3.3, feel free!
- As noted above, ensure that it is patched before using 3.3's import feature.
- The changes were made into a discreet patch here (The patch may assist with porting changes to 3.3 manually, but cannot be applied to versions other than 2.0.23 automatically):

### System Requirements

#### Shims for phpBB 2 on PHP 8.x
These reqirements are technically not new but must be done (as of May 2024 php8 branch) since the server was already upgraded to php 8.x.

These shims only apply to using phpBB 2 (or other old PHP code) under PHP 8.x or later, which has removed some functions that were deprecated in earlier versions.

```bash
REPOS=/opt/git`
# ^ if using managed hosting, change this to `REPOS=$HOME/git`
mkdir $REPOS
cd $REPOS || echo "Don't do the rest if you see this error!"
git clone https://github.com/Hierosoft/php-ereg-shim-procedural.git
git clone https://gitlab.com/poikilos/mysql-shim.git
git switch php8
# ^ If git switch php8 fails, the pull request may be complete at the upstream repo:
#   https://gitlab.com/dotpointer/mysql-shim.git
#   In which case the branch would no longer be necessary and the default branch can be used at the upstream repo
#   (no git switch would be necessary, but use the upstream address instead).
#   See [Do not send NULL to mysql error functions (prevent PHP 8.2 crash when there is no link).](https://gitlab.com/dotpointer/mysql-shim/-/merge_requests/1)
git clone https://github.com/ChristiaanBye/polyfill-each.git
```
- May require the fork of mysql-shim too at <https://gitlab.com/poikilos/mysql-shim/-/tree/php8> if the site crashes when there is no database connection.

These shims can be prepended to every php file automatically. This is necessary so that all php files in phpBB 2 (and other PHP files with old calls) have access to the old functions. To do so, follow either the VPS or managed hosting instructions below.

### VPS instructions
If your are using a VPS (or similar setup such as a dedicated server), run these two commands (again, only works/necessary if using PHP 8.0 or higher):
```bash
# First make sure you've set the REPOS folder appropriately
#   as described in earlier steps.
# There can only be one auto_prepend_file, so make a loader first:
echo '<?php' | tee $REPOS/php8-shims.php
echo "require '$REPOS/mysql-shim/mysql-shim.php';" | tee -a $REPOS/php8-shims.php
echo "require '$REPOS/php-ereg-shim-procedural/php-ereg-shim-procedural.php';" | tee -a $REPOS/php8-shims.php
echo "require '$REPOS/polyfill-each/polyfill-each.php';" | tee -a $REPOS/php8-shims.php
echo '?>' | tee -a $REPOS/php8-shims.php
```

example $REPOS/php8-shims.php (generated by commands above if REPOS is /opt/git):
```php
<?php
require '/opt/git/mysql-shim/mysql-shim.php';
require '/opt/git/php-ereg-shim-procedural/php-ereg-shim-procedural.php';
require '/opt/git/polyfill-each/polyfill-each.php';
?>
```

Load the shims file every time php runs:
```bash
echo "auto_prepend_file=$REPOS/php8-shims.php" | sudo tee /etc/php.d/95-php8-shims.ini
```

User-space http daemon instructions:
- In the steps above, change `tee` to `tee -a` if you use php.ini directly otherwise it will be overwritten! These steps use case-specific ini files which only exist for loading these shims.
- Remove `sudo` if using shared hosting (or have configured a user-space http daemon) which would already provide your user with priveleges to edit a php.ini or php.d for your specific website (Use the path for that instead of `/etc/` in that case, otherwise these configuration files may never get loaded).

### Managed Web Hosting Instructions
If using managed web hosting (not a VPS), first use the alternate path for cloning as instructed above then enter the following using the php ini editor in the host's control panel (still only works/necessary if using PHP 8.0 or higher):
```bash
auto_prepend_file=/home/USER/mysql-shim/mysql-shim.php
auto_prepend_file=/home/USER/php-ereg-shim-procedural/php-ereg-shim-procedural.php
```
- You *must* manually change USER to your web user's username in the text above. You can avoid this if you are in a shell where you have write access to a user-space ini (In that case see "User-space http daemon instructions" further up instead).
